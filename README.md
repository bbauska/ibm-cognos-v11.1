  <li>What is IBM Cognos Analytics?</li>
  <p style="color:darkgreen;">
    IBM Cognos Business Intelligence is a web based reporting and analytic tool. It is used to perform data aggregation and create user friendly detailed reports.<br> Reports can contain:
  <ul><li>Graphs,</li> 
    <li>Multiple Pages,</li>
    <li>Different Tabs and</li>
    <li>Interactive Prompts.</li>
  </ul><br>
These reports can be viewed on web browsers, or on hand held devices like tablets and smartphones.<br>
Cognos also provides you an option to export the report in XML or PDF format or you can view the reports in XML format. <br>
You can also schedule the report to run in the background at specific time period so it saves the time to view the daily report as you don’t need to run the report every time.<br>
IBM Cognos provides a wide range of features and can be considered as an enterprise software to provide flexible reporting environment and can be used for large and medium enterprises. <br>
It meets the need of Power Users, Analysts, Business Managers and Company Executives. Power users and analysts want to create ad hoc reports and can create multiple views of the same data. Business Executives want to see summarize data in dashboard styles, cross tabs and visualizations. Cognos allows both the options for all set of users.

  <h4>Top Ten Cognos and Planning Analytics Features in 2022</h4>
  <ul>
  <li>10. Learn Panel in Cognos and Planning Analytics.  IBM spent considerable resources on the quality and usefulness of documentation on both products.  The learn panel is intuitive, gets you answers quickly and even suggests things to view as you look something up.  It includes webpages, videos, tutorials, and documents.  Let’s say you need to figure out a rule in Planning Analytics or how to set up bursting in Cognos Analytics.  Simply start typing in the learn panel and watch the magic happen.</li>
  <li>9. Insights in Visualization using Analytics Panel in Cognos Analytics.  Insights in visualizations provide analytic insights that can help users to detect and validate any important relationships and meaningful differences based on the data that is presented by the visualization.  The type of insights depends on the displayed data by the visualization.  Available types of insights are Average, Predictive strength, Meaningful Differences, Fit Line, and Most Frequent.  Average provides the mean of the displayed summaries, and most frequent the category or category that appears most often in the data.  The rest of the insights depend on more advanced analytics and statistical tests.  The goal is to provide reliable information that you can use for an enhanced description of the viewed data and discovery of any relationships that are expected to be found in the population that is represented by this data. </li>
  <li>8. Explorations in Cognos Analytics.  Explore is a flexible workspace where you can discover and analyze data.  You can also explore an existing visualization from a dashboard or story, uncover hidden relationships and identify patterns that turn your data into insights.  Correlated insights are represented by a green icon with a number on the x-axis, y-axis, or the title of a chart.  Ok that was the technical speak.  Now for my thoughts.  At first, I didn’t really get why explorations could be powerful or why you would even use it.  After spending some time really getting to understand how explorations can work and how much effort IBM has put into improving them, I’m a big fan.  Simple case, select 2 points of your data and let the system tell you what to start to look at.  Pin that information and quickly use it in a dashboard.  Speaking of pins.  This is 8.1 of my favorite things in Cognos Analytics.  Pinning visualizations allows you to save information and use it across Cognos Analytics in a quick and efficient way.</li>
  <li>7. Planning Analytics for Excel (PAFe) in Planning Analytics.  Everyone loves Excel!  With PAfe you can have an excel experience in Planning Analytics while exploring data, reporting or inputting data.  You can create several different items in PAFe.

 Explorations – slice and dice your data
Static – Create a report that is disconnected from the PA database and send to anyone
Dynamic – Create presentation style reports and also create data input files
Custom – Start from scratch and build what you want.
    By the way, whatever you create in PAFe, you can publish to Planning Analytics Workspace</li>
  <li>6. Data Models and Data Sets in Cognos Analytics.  You can use data modeling in Cognos Analytics to fuse together many sources of data, including relational databases, Hadoop-based technologies, Microsoft Excel spreadsheets, text files, and so on.  Using these sources, a data module is created that can then be used in reports, dashboards, or explorations.  Data sets are customized collections of data items that you use frequently.  As you make updates to the data set, the dashboards, stories, or explorations that use that data set are also updated the next time you run them.  You can create data sets from packages or data modules, and use as sources to create dashboards, stories, explorations, and data modules.</li>
  <li>5. Navigation Paths and Relative Time in Cognos Analytics.  To expand on your Dashboards and Reports using data models and data sets, use navigation paths and relative time.

Navigation Paths – provide a drill up and down feature to your data.  In data models or dashboards simply click on the navigation path area and create your drill path.  Go from Country, to State, to City with clicks of a button in your data and visualizations.
Relative Time – with a few clicks of a button create YTD, QTD, MTD, last month, current month and so many more relative time filters in your data to be used across Cognos.</li>
    <li>4. Dashboards in Cognos Analytics.  Dashboards in Cognos Analytics has come a long way over time and especially in the last year.  First, with Cognos Analytics version 11.2.1 the speed to render improved signficantly.  IBM has added in a ton of formatting enhancmenets from colors, fonts and the like.  There are many new visualizations that compete with other BI products available and you can now export the dashboard to a PDF document.  All things considered I believe Cognos Analytics dashboards compete and exceed any BI product available!</li>
    <li>3. Applications and Plans in Planning Analytics.  Applications and Plans have seen significant enhancements in 2022.  Honestly, Planning Analytics Workspace has improved so much that it is imperative you own it and use it.</li>
    <li>2. AI Assistant in Cognos Analytics.  The AI assistant is game changing for Cognos Analytics.  It has gained so many enhancements over the past year that if you are not using this, you are missing out.  In Cognos Analytics version 11.2.2 and 11.2.3, the AI assistant added in time specific filtering.  Things like:

 Show sales this Thursday
Show sales between last Monday and last Wednesday
Show me sales for camping equipment from June 1-5
What is the total income between Halloween and Christmas
Show sales for 2021
Show October 2021 sales by product
YTD, QTD, MTD and abbreviations like Mon for Monday and Thur for Thursday and Xmas for Christmas to narrow your search in the assistant.
Type in “Show quantity between 1/1/20 and 2/29/20” and let the system generate visualizations based on what you typed. </li>
    <li>1. Workspace in Planning Analytics.  Finally, my favorite feature in Cognos and Planning Analytics is Workspace.  IBM has done an excellent job with Workspace in Planning Analytics and I’m going to spend a little time on why you should be using this.  And if you don’t already own it, why you should reach out to us at sales@lodestarsolutions.com to discuss adding this to your license entitlements.

IBM Planning Analytics Workspace is a web-based interface for IBM Planning Analytics with Watson™.  It provides an interface to TM1® data, with ways to plan, create, and analyze your content.

Planning Analytics Workspace helps you focus on the things that matter to your business. Using Planning Analytics Workspace, you can identify and understand patterns and relationships in data.  You can use this information to understand why things happen and predict what might happen. Planning Analytics Workspace opens the world of advanced analytics to all business users.

IBM has spent an enormous amount of time building Workspace to be your A to Z space to build models, input data, analyze data and reports.

Over the past year IBM introduced the Workbench in Workspace.  This is the main area for modelers to create TI processes, dimensions, cubes, rules and everything else you need to build your models.  Those of you who build models in Architect remember having multiple windows open to simply create a cube.  Now with the Workbench you have a flexible space that allows multiple windows open in one place adding great efficiency to the model building task.</li>

Introduction to Data Modules

What is a Data Module
Data modules are containers that describe data and rules for combining and shaping data to prepare it for analysis and visualization in Cognos® Analytics. Data modules are saved in Team content or My content.

When you create a new data module from the home screen of IBM® Cognos Analytics, you are presented with five possible input sources in Sources. These sources are described here.
<ul>
<li>Data modules<br>
Data modules are source objects that contain data from data servers, uploaded files, or other data modules, and are saved in My content or Team content.</li>
<li>Data servers<br>
Data servers are databases for which connections exist. For more information, see Managing IBM Cognos Analytics .</li>
<li>Uploaded files<br>
Uploaded files are data that are stored with the Upload files facility.</li>
<li>Data sets<br>
Data sets contain extracted data from a package or a data module, and are saved in My content or Team content.</li>
<li>Packages<br>
Packages are created in IBM Cognos Framework Manager and contain dimensions, query subjects, and other data contained in Cognos Framework Manager projects. You can use packages as sources for a data module.</li>
</ul>

You can combine multiple sources into one data module. After you add a source,
click Add sources (Add a data source.) in Selected sources to add another source. You can use a combination of data source types in a data module.

Each type of data source is described in the following topics.

Using a data module source
Saved data modules can be used as data sources for other data modules. When a data module is used as a source for another data module, parts of that module are copied into the new data module.
Using a data server source
Data servers are databases for which connections exist and can be used as sources for data modules.
Using an uploaded file source
Uploaded files are data that is stored with the Upload files facility. You can use these files as sources for a data module.
Using a data set source
Data sets contain data that is extracted from a package or a data module, and are saved in My content or Team content.
Using a package source
Packages are created in IBM Cognos Framework Manager. You can use relational, dynamic query mode packages as sources for data modules.
Creating a simple data module
You can create a simple data module based on the Great Outdoors Warehouse sales database that is included in IBM Cognos Analytics extended samples.
Relinking sources
You can relink a data module source to a different source. After a successful relink, global calculations and relationships in the data module remain valid.
